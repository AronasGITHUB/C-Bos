# C-Bos
 A command-line app made in C++ for fun.
 Originally made in python but this is the official rewrite.

# How to use
 If you dont want to compile from source then just download the latest version and run the exe
 Then type `help`

# How to compile from source
 Install [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) installed (search up a tutorial on how to install it)
 Then run `g++ main.cpp in the cbos dir` and it should be compiled!
 Also the exe only works on windows but you can just compile it for your platform.
